"""Pi coding-task client.

Runs the Pi CLI (https://pi.dev) in headless agentic mode inside a target
workspace so it can implement a coding task (read/write/edit/bash), then captures
what changed via git. This is the *hands* role for Pi, the inverse of the
``integrations/llm_cli`` provider role (the *brain*).

Execution model: Pi runs as a child process that is **polled to a deadline**
(``_poll_process``) rather than a single blocking call, so a long task is bounded
and the process is terminated gracefully (SIGTERM, then SIGKILL) on timeout.

Safety model (see issue: "Add Pi as an integration and tool for submitting
coding tasks"): the task prompt forbids commits/pushes and destructive git
commands, and the caller gates invocation (the ``tools`` layer only runs this when
``PI_CODING_ENABLED`` is set — off by default, since the tool is offered on the
investigation surface). This module only edits the working tree and reports the
diff; it never commits, pushes, or opens a PR.
